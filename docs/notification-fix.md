# Notification Sync Fix

If you recently reinstalled boxlore or migrated to a new Android device, you might notice that you are no longer receiving push notifications for new episodes, even though the toggle switches in the app show they are turned **ON**.

Here is why this happens and how you can fix it in under a minute.

## Why did this happen?

1. **Database Restore**: When you reinstall boxlore, Android's Auto Backup system automatically restores your local database (your subscriptions, listening history, and settings).
2. **New Token**: Because the app was reinstalled, your device generated a fresh Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) token.
3. **Missing Subscriptions**: While your settings show notifications are enabled, the new FCM token was never registered to the podcast release topics on Firebase.

## How to fix it (Step-by-Step)

To force your new device token to register with Firebase, follow these quick steps:

1. Open **boxlore**.
2. Go to your **Library** and select a podcast you want notifications for.
3. Tap the **Notification Toggle** (bell icon) to turn it **OFF**.
4. Tap the toggle again to turn it **ON**.
5. Repeat this for other subscribed podcasts if necessary.

Toggling the setting off and back on forces boxlore to send your new token to Firebase and re-subscribe you to the correct release topics.

## Will this happen again?

**No.** We have implemented a permanent fix in upcoming version to patch this, so your next update will be seamless. The app now automatically checks for new device installs and reconciles your notification preferences on launch, so you will never have to manually re-toggle them again.

Thank you for your patience, and happy listening!
