# `:feature:explore`

## Purpose

Owns Explore discovery and the Learn tab presentation: browse/search discovery, Learn curiosity cards, Learn history, and local UI state for those surfaces. It does not own recommendation engines, network clients, preference storage, playback services, or other feature screens.

## Public API

- `ExploreScreen` and `ExploreViewModel` for the Explore route.
- `LearnScreen` and `LearnViewModel` for the Learn route.
- `LearnHistoryScreen` and `LearnHistoryViewModel` for Learn history.
- `LearnCuriosityHistoryStore` for Learn history persistence through prefs APIs.
- `LearnCuriosityCard` as the feature UI model for curiosity cards.

## Dependencies

- Project dependencies: `:core:designsystem`, `:core:catalog`, `:core:playback`, `:core:model`, `:core:network`, `:core:analytics`, `:core:ranking`, and `:core:prefs`.
- Libraries: Compose, Navigation, Coil, lifecycle runtime/ViewModel Compose, Palette, Turbine and coroutines-test for tests.
- Reverse-edge rule: feature modules must not depend on other feature modules.

## Threading / lifecycle

- ViewModels are scoped by app navigation.
- Catalog, playback, ranking, analytics, and prefs access come through injected application-scoped dependencies.
- UI runs on the main thread; search, recommendation, and history work use suspend APIs.

## Persistence & identity

- This module owns no raw storage files.
- Learn history and recommendation caches are accessed through `BoxcastPrefs` in `:core:prefs`.
- Network DTOs map to feature UI models before entering UI state.

## Testing notes

- Unit tests live under `feature/explore/src/test`.
- Existing coverage includes Learn pagination, Learn deck logic, and Explore browse logic.
- Prefer fakes for repository and prefs dependencies when expanding ViewModel coverage.

```bash
./gradlew :feature:explore:testDebugUnitTest
```

## CI relevance

- `unit-tests.yml` runs Explore JVM tests with the project suite.
- No dedicated instrumented job is configured for this module.
